This repo contains the datasets and code for the ADS Project.

# Introduction
Our group will focus on the analysis of the impact of human mobility on the spread of COVID-19 in the United States nationwide, based on the data from Google and CSSE. By cleaning, aggregating, fitting with machine learning models, and visualizing data, we will be working on modeling for COVID-19 cases prediction based on changes in human mobility. In addition, we will summarize the result of the data analysis and make our recommendations on policies of containing the disease.
